# Lithic API

This is a simple API written in python to query ChatGPT and have it process vocabulary sheets and assignments in a digestable way.

The main reason I wrote this in python (rather than just including it in the lithic app) is because of the ease of use
when it came to processing youtube transcripts into models I knew how to work with. The main focus of this project is the React Native app I am writing, so this api may become obsolete in the future.

Use at your own risk.
